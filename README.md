well this i my first php project, this is from times before i learned object orientation. 

it was back then the first language we learned , where we also learned a gui to it, the html in this case.

before i already made a roulete game for console. 

so this is a website where u can set bets as in rl roulette and then can let it run fast forward and see hundreds of the next random rolls. 

as u will see there is one bet for all picked numbers.  it would need at every number the textfields, its really oldschool kinda just having a gui and did it. 

Sure would be beautiful to do it nicely with javascript. why not. 

then u see how ur credit is rising or decreasing. its interesting how the random times, when all chosen numbers gets rolled a lot in short time periods, happening right.
its kind of true if you have unlimited funds you can Most of the time win the money back. there is a point where it would be prolly imposible that the lucky numbers get
rolled so many times, tho it would be possible if you let it run unlimited time..  murphy got us. 

so sometimes if u let it run, and lets say your bet was 400 euro bet on 5-10 numbers and on rows and maybe color aswell. 
so u let run the package and its interesting when its going to be in plus again or ever again. 

its now going towards quantum phyisics right.

so for example the 400 euro bet with 5000euro credits right , easier like 50 euro with 4 euro bets, NOT a lot space to maybe see wining numbers,
most of the times u loose.. its facts, the more you play the more sure you will loose there is no way arround it i guess :)

so this is a readme for the gamblers out there who forget to see logicly what they actualy doing and that no control of this is possible.

only way you bet real higher and win super high.  But that again goes in the chances of luck section, wich as said, The More u play, The More u loose... 

anyways its beautiful to see and back then to learn that php is such a nice language for backend situations.

javascript is in this code 2-3 rows, its for the automatic refresh of the page. since php needs a refresh to be ran again.

btw the "back then" I am talking about is end of 2021. so this was the first game with a graphical user interface.

after that came the Black Jack project wich i did in Java (still at this time not really knowing about oop). so I learned the oop there for first, tho my 
code already written in functional thinking, I used then some what i learned for creating objects, when the cards get picked, so just as many cards as picked 
will be created as objects in an array, and then deleted fine so its not static fields they come when needed know how to place themselfs near the last card.
its been beautiful realizations and understandings for me

so enough said looking forward to learn more and spend time successfully coding.
