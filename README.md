well this i my first php project, this is from times before i learned object orientation. 

it was back then the first language I learned after python. and the first one where I could use a Gui, the html/css

earlier i already made a roulette game for console only. 

so this is a website where u can set bets as in roulette and then can let it run fast forward and see hundreds of the next random rolls. 

as u will see there is one bet for all picked numbers.  it would need at every number the textfields, its really oldschool kinda the way how to type in and select. 

(Sure would be beautiful to do it nicely with javascript.  )

then u see how ur credit is rising or decreasing. its interesting how the random times, when all chosen numbers gets rolled a lot in short time periods, happening right.
every roll is documentated aswell as the history of the credit. its on the second page if u stop the autorefresh. 
Tho the auto refresh not working right now idk what changed in the browsers, anyways still can roll one by one

its kind of true if you have unlimited funds you can Most of the time win the money back. there is a point where it would be prolly imposible that the lucky numbers getting rolled so many times, tho it would be possible if you let it run unlimited time..  maybe. 

so for example the 400 euro bet with 5000euro credits right , easier like 50 euro with 4 euro bets, NOT a lot space to maybe see wining numbers,
most of the times u loose.. its facts, the more you play the more sure you will loose there is no way arround it if u not bet higher.

only way is maybe if you bet real higher and win super high compensating the losses. But that again goes in the chances of luck section, wich as said, The More u play, The More u loose... 

anyways its beautiful to see and back then to learn that php is such a nice language for backend situations.

javascript is in this code 2-3 rows, its for the automatic refresh of the page. since php needs a refresh to be ran again.

btw the "back then" I am talking about is end of 2021. so this was the first game with a graphical user interface I did.

after that came the Black Jack project wich i did in Java (still at that time not really knowing about oop). so I learned the oop there for the first time, tho my 
code already written in functional thinking, I used then some what i learned for creating objects, when the cards get picked, so just as many cards as picked 
will be created as objects in an array, and then deleted fine so its not static fields they come when needed know how to place themselfs near the last card.

so enough said looking forward to learn more and spend time successfully coding.
